# NINAH.WalkSpeed

Slight movement tweaks for No, I'm not a Human.

Adds sprinting and crouching. Default keys are:
Sprint - Shift
Crouch - LeftControl

You can change the sprint speed using the - and = keys. This can be changed in the config file:
bepinex/config/com.vainstar.NINAH.WalkSpeed.cfg

This mod also sets the acceleration for walking to 999 so the movement feels snappier.
