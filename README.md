# NINAH.MovementTweaks

Slight movement tweaks for No, I'm not a Human.

Adds sprinting and crouching. 

You can change the sprint speed using the - and = keys. This can be changed in the config file:
bepinex/config/com.vainstar.NINAH.WalkSpeed.cfg

This mod also sets the acceleration for walking to 999 so the movement feels snappier. If you dont like this, you can press Right Alt (default key, can be changed in cfg) to disable it.
